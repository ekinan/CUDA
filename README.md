Here is the CUDA code that I wrote while doing an independent study with Prof.
Bryant York at Portland State University in Winter 2016. Please view the READMEs
in the corresponding directories for more details on each.

Note: These programs must be run on a CUDA machine.

To compile any of the programs, please type,
	nvcc <program-name>.cu
into the command prompt.

To run the program, please type
	./a.out
into the command prompt.
